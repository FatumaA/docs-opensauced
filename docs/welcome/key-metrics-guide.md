Welcome to Key Metrics Guide, where we define main metrics used on our platform to help you understand them better.

## OSCR

[OSCR](../glossary/#oscr) stands for Open Source Contributor Rating. It is a way to measure and rate the impact of your open-source contributions over 90 days.

This helps you understand the quality and frequency of your contributions. It is a good way to measure your open source activities and takes into account many factors.

You can read more about [what it is and how to improve it](../../opensauced-guides/oscr-score-guide/oscr-guide/).

## Contributor Confidence

[Contributor Confidence](../glossary/#contributor-confidence) is a metric that measures how likely contributors who have interacted with a repository via stars or forks are to contribute in some way. It is measured as a percentage calculated over a specified time range.

This helps you evaluate whether a repository you are interested in provides a good environment for new contributors. A positive score implies that the project is welcoming to new contributors, that your contributions are likely to be accepted, and that your participation in the community is nurtured.
