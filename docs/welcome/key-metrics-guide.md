Welcome to Key Metrics Guide, where we define main metrics used on our platform to help you understand them better.

## OSCR

[OSCR](../glossary/#oscr) stands for Open Source Contributor Rating. It is a way to measure and rate the impact of your open-source contributions over 90 days.

This helps you understand the quality and frequency of your contributions. It is a good way to measure your open source activities and takes into account many factors.

You can read more about [what it is and how to improve it](../../opensauced-guides/oscr-score-guide/oscr-guide/).

## Contributor Confidence

[Contributor Confidence](../glossary/#contributor-confidence) is a metric that measures how likely contributors who have interacted with a repository via stars or forks are to contribute in some way. It is measured as a percentage calculated over a specified time range.

This helps you evaluate whether a repository you are interested in provides a good environment for new contributors. A positive score implies that the project is welcoming to new contributors, that your contributions are likely to be accepted, and that your participation in the community is nurtured.

## OpenSSF Score

[OpenSSF Score](../glossary/#ossf-scorecard) is a metric that measures how secure an open-source project is based on how compliant the repository is to OpenSSF’s standards. It is scored out of 10 and uses [OpenSSF’s CLI tool](https://scorecard.dev/#what-is-openssf-scorecard) under the hood to help calculate this score.

[OpenSSF](https://openssf.org) refers to the Open-source security foundation, a group of security-focused tech professionals who are trying to enable the open-source ecosystem to create safe, open software in compliance with the [EU’s Cyber Resilience Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act).

This helps you evaluate how secure a repository is and how attentive maintainers are to compliance issues. It is a good metric to consider when contributing to a repository.

## Lottery Factor

[Lottery Factor](../glossary/#lottery-factor) is a metric that measures the risk that comes with a project’s dependence on one or a few key contributors. It measures how many pull requests are made by the most active contributors as a percentage.

This helps you understand whether or not a repository is at risk of abandonment should a key contributor become unavailable. This information is particularly important if you plan on being a long-term contributor or if your project relies on an open-source project for the long term.
